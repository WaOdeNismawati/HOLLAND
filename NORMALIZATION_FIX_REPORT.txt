NORMALIZATION FIX - SUMMARY REPORT
===================================
Date: 2025-12-15
Issue: Multiple students with DIFFERENT personality profiles were getting SAME major recommendations

ROOT CAUSE:
-----------
Major profiles in database had TOO HIGH and TOO GENERAL scores (sum > 4.0).
Example:
  Hubungan Masyarakat: sum=4.40 (E=1.0, S=1.0, A=0.8, etc.)
  Perhotelan: sum=4.40 (E=1.0, S=1.0, R=0.6, etc.)

This made them "generalists" that matched ALL profiles.

SOLUTION APPLIED:
-----------------
Normalized all 45 major profiles to sum=3.0 (average 0.5 per criterion).
This makes each major more SPECIFIC and only match relevant personality types.

RESULTS:
--------
BEFORE:
  Elmy (EIS)   => Hubungan Masyarakat
  Izatil (AEI) => Hubungan Masyarakat  (SAME - WRONG!)
  Kadek (ISC)  => Hubungan Masyarakat  (SAME - WRONG!)

AFTER:
  Elmy (EIS)   => Hubungan Internasional  (E+S match)
  Izatil (AEI) => Desain Komunikasi Visual  (A match)
  Kadek (ISC)  => Kedokteran  (I+S match)

All recommendations now DIFFERENT and LOGICAL!

FILES:
------
- Backup: majors_backup_20251215_213047.csv
- Modified: exam_system.db (majors table)
- Scripts: normalize_majors.py, validate_normalization.py

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
Students who already took the test will need to:
1. View their NEW recommendations (auto-calculated on page load)
OR
2. Admin can re-run calculations for all students with update script

STATUS: FIXED AND VALIDATED
